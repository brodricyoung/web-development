			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to provide an easy-to-use and secure platform for tracking student progress on vital learning competencies within our local school district. It allows students and parents to view competency completion status in real time, while giving teachers the ability to update and manage records for each student. By organizing this information in a clear, accessible format, the site supports communication between educators, students, and families, helping everyone stay informed and engaged in the learning process.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Students, parents, teachers, and administrators in the school district will be accessing this site to view or update a students vital competencies.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>After logging in through Firebase Authentication, JavaScript will determine the user's role (student, parent, or teacher) and conditionally display the appropriate interface using DOM manipulation. For example, students and parents will see only that studentâ€™s competency records, while teachers will have full access to view and update all records. These records will be stored as objects in Firebase Firestore and managed using arrays with methods like filter and forEach to efficiently display data. JavaScript functions will handle tasks such as rendering data, responding to input events, and updating the database, demonstrating clear code organization. Event listeners will be used to handle actions like clicking buttons to mark competencies as complete or incomplete, and elements will be dynamically updated in response. The site will use ES modules to organize code across files and maintain clean structure.</p>

            <p>Duchesne County School District Secondary School Vital Compentencies</p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the vital competencies is to help students accomplish the mission of the school district. which is, "Graduates of Duchesne County School District have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to lead fulfilling lives." Within the Accountability-Based Competency System, these vital competencies allow for the continuation of traditional school with traditional instruction of the core standards, but it also includes the skills and dispositions our young people need so very much. By skills we are talking about critical thinking, collaboration, informed decision making and creativity. By dispositions we mean creativity, hard work, respect, and integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within each competency area (knowledge, skills, dispositions) there will be 2-4 required tasks and 5-7 optional tasks. Obviously, each student will need to complete/pass all of the required tasks. Then, to achieve the distinguished (blue ribbon) status, students will need to complete at least four of the optional tasks as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each student will have an adult in the school who is their advocate to help them along through their competency process. This advocate adult will help them understand the requirements, encourage them to do their best, provide guidance and feedback, and can pass off any of the items on the list. Subject area teachers can also pass off items on the list that are within their area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students are expected to work on all the competencies (required and optional) throughout the school year. Many of the competencies will be worked on naturally through the regular schedule of school. Students may also work on them when there is extension time in class as well as at home. Students are accountable to track their progress with the support of the school advocate and the family.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are excited to roll out a school system that honors such time-tested traits as integrity, respect, hard work, creativity, informed decision making, collaboration, etc! Thank you for partnering with us as we strive to help our students live fulfilling lives!

				This page will be dynamically reated based on who is signed in. The first is for if a student or parent of only one student is signed in. They can only see the one students information. The second is for if an administrator, teacher, or parent of multiple students is signed in. They will be able to select which student to view from varying lists of students based on their role. Teachers will also be able to edit the competencies as either Complete or Incomplete. Administrators can do the same and also edit what the competency requirement is.
